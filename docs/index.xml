      <description>Overview At the core of every glurmo simulation there is a settings directory, .glurmo, which contains three configuration files: settings.json, script_template, and slurm_template. We will start by going through each of these files in turn.&#xA;settings.json settings.json is the file in which you specify the general settings of your simulation as well as the specific parameters for the script and the slurm script. We will go over each of these in turn, but first, an important note: you cannot use comments in settings.</description>

      <description>Setting up the simulation In order to run the simulations, we must set up the directory. This entails glurmo creating the actual scripts and slurm scripts, as well as setting up the general directory structure. To set up the directory, ensure your current directory is simple-lm, and then run:&#xA;$ glurmo -s . Note that you can also run setup from a different directory, as the final argument is simply the path to whichever directory you&amp;rsquo;d like to run glurmo on.</description>

      <description>Running the simulations Now, for the moment you&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for (I assume?): running the simulation study. To run all the simulations, run:&#xA;$ glurmo -r 5 . This will submit all five simulations. Note that you can replace &amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; with any positive number, and glurmo will run that many (or at least the maximum number in the study). Note that glurmo will keep track of what simulations have and have not been run; if you run the same command above again, glurmo will submit no jobs, since all jobs will either be running or completed.</description>

      <description>Conclusion This has been a fairly basic introduction to glurmo, and hopefully it has made some of the benefits clear to you:&#xA;glurmo makes it easy to keep your simulations and results organized glurmo makes it easy to re-use various aspects of your simulations in future simulations glurmo helps you avoid worrying about the nitty-gritty paths you use by giving you access to script specific variables However, if you&amp;rsquo;ve run simulation studies, this all probably raises a pretty natural question: what if you want to vary parameters in the simulation?</description>

      <description>Introducing parameter vectors If you open varied-lm/.glurmo/settings.json, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that it&amp;rsquo;s more or less the same as the last settings file, with one exception:&#xA;... &amp;#34;beta_1&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;@[1, 2, 3]&amp;#34;, ... This parameter uses a parameter vector. A parameter vector has the syntax @[param 1, param 2, ... param n], and serve a special purpose in glurmo. Each parameter in the vector represents a distinct simulation setting, and a separate simulation directory will be made for it.</description>

      <description>Running the simulation There are two ways we could run this simulation. Since all three subdirectories are themselves complete glurmo directories, we could simply go to each of them in turn in whatever order we choose and run them sequentially. However, we can also run them all in parallel from the varied-lm directory.&#xA;To do so, ensure you are in the varied-lm subdirectory, and simply run the command:&#xA;$ glurmo -r 5 .</description>

      <description>Multiple parameter vectors If we look at .glurmo/settings.json we will see a new change in addition to the one from the previous section:&#xA;... &amp;#34;N&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;@[100, 200, 300]&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;beta_0&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;,&#x9;&amp;#34;beta_1&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;@[1, 2, 3]&amp;#34;, ... Now, in addition to varying beta_1, we&amp;rsquo;ll be varying the sample size N as well.&#xA;Setting up We can set up this simulation in exactly the same way as before. As always, ensure you are in the simulation directory and run:</description>

      <description>Running the simulation Finally, we will run the simulation in the same way as we did previously:&#xA;$ glurmo -r 5 . You should see the following message:&#xA;Successfully submitted 45 jobs Just to be explicit: we have submitted five jobs per setting, and there are three settings for beta_1 times three settings for N for a total of nine settings. The output, as always, will be saved to the results folder of each simulation subdirectory.</description>

      <description>Templating logic Suppose we decide that only one gigabyte of memory is pushing it for the simulations where N is set to 300. We could simply change the memory parameter to &amp;ldquo;2g&amp;rdquo;, but as discussed in the introduction, this might not be ideal. It would be nice if we could set all the settings where N is less than 300 to run with 1 gigabyte of RAM, and those where N is 300 (and eventually greater) to run with 2 gigabytes of RAM.</description>

      <description>Running the simulation For the sake of completeness, let&amp;rsquo;s run the simulation to make sure everything worked as expected:&#xA;$ glurmo -r 5 . The results should be exactly the same as previous simulations, and you can find them in the same places.</description>
